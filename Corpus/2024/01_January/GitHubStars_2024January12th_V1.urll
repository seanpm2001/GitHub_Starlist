//// DATE: 2024, Friday, January 12th
//// Starting 2023 September 9th, I am now increasing the daily star, watch, and fork count, due to a lack of progress on my timeline. I will now fork 92-100 repositories per day, instead of 17-25 repositories per day
//// Starting 2024, Monday, January 8th, I have gone back to 17-25 repositories per day, instead of 92-100, due to issues with time and this system not working out for that reason. I will have to remind myself that there will need to be daily data to fork, and that I shouldn't rush through it all anymore like I was. Some days may be set aside to do extra if the queue grows too much again.
