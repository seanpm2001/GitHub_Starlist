# Plans

This project will be automated with [@AUTOMATE-2001](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001/) and will showcase all my GitHub stars. Each branch will have a different account of stars, with about 2-4 accounts total. It will serve as a primary database of all my GitHub stars.

Currently, a limited corpus of stars is available for use until the automation is done.

The automation will create a single file with every star I have given, categorized by repository and account. It will also contain separate index files for each individual starred repository, which won't be sorted by accounts.

Star lists will also be their own separate category.
